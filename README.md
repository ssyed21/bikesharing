##Summary
Based on the visuals there are more Male riders using citibikes, and the bikes are used often at 8 am and 5pm when the workday starts and ends. There is also most use from subscribers vs customers. Another visual that could be beneficial is one showcasing hotspots in the city. Also a visual that shows the age range of users would be beneficial.
